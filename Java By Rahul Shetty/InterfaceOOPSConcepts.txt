Interface OOPS concept

Inteface is lies on the same line of class but the only difference between interface and class is that interface have methods but not the body

key point
1. Interface have methods but not the body
2. To implement the Interface we use 'implements' keywords
3. One class can implement more than one interfaces
4.Interface contain all incomplete method that is called abstract method
5.Access specifier in the interfaces must be public and if we have variable then its also public
