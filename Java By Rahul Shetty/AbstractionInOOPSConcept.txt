Abstraction In OOPS Concepts

if the class contain the any method which do not have body then this is called as abstract method and due to this , this class also become the abstract class

Means abstract class can contain the concreat method (which is called comlete method having the opening curly braces called body) as well as incomplete method (which do not have
have body)

so if the class contain only one abstract method then class become abstract  

You can not create the object of the abstract class (we can say the parent class which become abstract due to incomplete method present inside this class)

if the parent class of any method define with private access modifier then you can not inheritate or implement that private method . So the role of abtraction is to 
implement the incomplete method and that should not lies with private access modifier

Abstraction is also called partial abstraction cause it contain complete and incomplete method

Interface is fully abstraction so interfaces contain only abtraction method

extends keyworld is used to achieve the abtraction


Real time scenario when Abstraction come into picture

There is parent class of Aircraft compony and which is global and manage all manufacturing data
