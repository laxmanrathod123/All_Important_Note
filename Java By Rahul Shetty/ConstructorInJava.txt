Constructor In Java

Key Point :

1. Whenerver you create the object constructor is called
2. If you are not defining the constructor then compiler will call the imlicit constructor
3. If you are defining the constructor explicitly then constructor get called and whaterver written in constructor get printed
4. Constructor do not return anything that is constructor dont have any return type
5. Constructor name is same as class name

There are two type of the constructor
1. Default constructor
2. Parameterized constructor

if we passed the parameter then first parameterized constructor will called
and if we dont pass the parameter then bydefault default constructor will called
