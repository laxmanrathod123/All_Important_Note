Application server can start at any point in Hosted server and can be acessed through 
HostedServerIpAddress: PortNumber

we can map HostedSErverIpAddres: PortNumber to any custom Doamin Name 
so that we can acess the applicatin server directly with the domain name

godaddy is the website where you can buy the domain name 

To leep our Developed App running on server and access if from anywhere ,we should first build the code so that build file will be generated .
These build files should be placed into App/Web Server and then we can access the developed App 
directly on the broser with 
HostedServerIPAddress: PortNumber or with Domain Name if mapped.
