Cloud computing 

You can create and access your  Resources from anywhere(Office,Restaurant,Beach,Travelling,Train ,buses,plane ,ship,car)by using any devive
(Laptop, tablet,desktop.smartphone)


Type of cloud Available

1.IAAS (Infrastructe As A Service)=> AWSEC2 , Google Compute Engine

If we want to run our service we need all physical hardware and setup and utilities then and then we run our server so instead of we are going with 
any cloud site and asking them our requirement and setting up the virtual server with them and start using that.

Pysical server Thing that needs for running any Service

Certain operating system(OS): Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Ubantu, Windows Server 2016
RAM : 8GB , 16GB , 32GB 
Processor: i3, i5, i7
Hard Disk: Magnetic/ SSD
NIC(Lan card or Network interface card) : 1GB, 10GB

Who will mostly used this services?
Network Engineer
Hardware Engineer

Some cloud compony :
Amazon(AWS)EC2 , Google Cloud , Azure

we will approach that compony and said we want virtual server.
and we will have one server that will be running on cloud 
 
2.PAAS (Platform As A Service)    => Red Hat,OpenShift ,Google APP Engine

PHP user means PHP is used to create some dyanamic website and dyanamic application for dynamic website we need also a database so Maria DB and MySQL 
is the database we need and when we worked with PHP we need APACHE webserver and we need LINUX as Operating System
So whole this combination is called as Stack and we required this and this is known as platform as service and you start using it and deploying service

all needed platform are in one shot 

Who will used this Service Mostly?
Mostly Programmer is used this service


3.SAAS(Storage As A Service)     => Dropbox ,Google drive

Now a day we are storing our data into the harddrive and lets say once it crash we dont have back up for that hard drive then we use this service 
to store the data safely on the cloud

we can stored our information on virtual machine eg.google drive, drop box

4.SAAS(Software As A Service)    => Google Docs,r

if we want to make any document then we need microsoft office so in this no need to installed any sofwared we are creating and storing our document in
cloud base application 

first need to create the key that is used for vertual server

Advantage of Cloud computing:

Pay as you go
Acess from anywhere,anytime,any devices
Economy of Scale
Flexibility
Expertly Managed
==================================================================================================================================================

Amazon EC2 Service is used to lauch a virtual server for free tier we can used upto 750 hours
Amazon S3 storage we can stored upto 5gb data for free tier
Amazon RDS Database we can used this for 750 hours
Amazon DynamoDB is NoSQL database we can used for 25GB storage
Amazon SageMaker is used for Machine Learning for every data scientist and developer
AWS Lambda is free for 1 million request per monnth
AWS SNS is used for publishing the notidication for 1 million per month for free tier
Amazon CludWatch for Monitoring AWS cloud resources and applications
====================================================================================================================================================
Root user => its having all previlages and IAM user which we need to create for giving the permission to use the our services to the another user

whenever you want to access the AWS resources you need to create the key Pair
Create Keipair Using AWs console

Serivices
EC2
Key Pair => click on this
create key pair => click
key pair type => RSA
Private key file format=> .pem (for used with OpenSSH and .ppk (for use with putty))

after creating the private key in .pem format save it

then download the putty and puttygen software
puttyGen software is used to convert the .pem format of private key into the ppk format 
open puttygen software laod the private key earlier we save and save it .it will automatically save the pem format into the ppk format

public and private key

whenever AWS is going to create the resources it is going to lock the resources using public key so if we unlock the resources then we need to 
use the correspondiong private key

so private key is used to Acess the resourcess
when we are going to create the private key then it is in pem format we need to convert it into the ppk format
=======================================================================================================================================================
 
 
Ec2 is used to create the virtual server where we need to select the all the configuration

click on EC2
Click on EC2 Dashboard
and then select the configure instance details
Seven step is involved in it

1.Choose AMI

2.Choose Instance Type

3.Configure instance

4.Add Storage

5.Add tags

6.Configure security Group
  
7.Reviews 

How you are going to lauch

search for EC2 service
click on EC2 Dashboard => create a key pairs => click on instance(Running) => click on Right corner for Lauch instance
your proper region should be selected (for local its mumbai)

  

Step 3) Configure Instance
=> select as per need

Step 4) Add Storage
=> select as per need

Step 5) Add tags
=> key        value
   Name       Linux Webserver

Step 6) Configure security Groups

tep 7) Review and Luanch


Tools for Accessing Cloud

Linux server is running in CLI on AWS Cloud Instance  =>  Windows client -putty and for Linux client - ssh

Linux server is running in GUI on AWS Cloud Instance  =>  Windows client -vnx for Linux client - vnc


How to install the webserver

linux commands

ls

sudo yum installed httpd  => This step is going to install our webserver

y  => we have to specifies yes

rpm -q httpd  => this step make sure our server is installed or not

cd /var/www/html      => we need to create the directory 

ls

cat >index.html

sudo-i

cd /var/www/html

cat >index.html

Welcome to Apache Web Server on EC2  => we can specify any message

systemctl start httpd     => This step start the server but its temporary start

systemctl start httpd     => To make it permantely type again



for window server RDP protocol is bydefault selected


Type of Storage

1.DAS -> Direct Attached Storage
eg. Pendrive and harddisk,usb

2.NAS -> Network Attached Storage

3.SAN -> Strorage Area Network

4.Object





































Cloud Computing Advantage

1.Pay as you go

if we are going to launch our server as instracture as a serice then we are lauching our server only for three hours ,so we will charge only for 3 hrs
after usage we can terminate our server and only pay for 3 hrs

2.Access from anywhere,anytime and any device

3.Economy of scale
 
we get the resources at cheaper rate

4. flexibility

we can change our requirement as we want like we want 1hd, ram and storage etc

5.Expertly Managed
very expert person managed the infrastructure
