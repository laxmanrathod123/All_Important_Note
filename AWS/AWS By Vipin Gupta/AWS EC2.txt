AWS EC2 (Elastic compute cloud)

How to lauch virtual Servers
EC2 means Infrastructure as service . This service is used to lauch the virtual sever

for physical server we are saying operating system (os) for virtual server we are saying AMI(Amazon Machine Image)

Instead of Physical server we need to create the virtual server by approaching any cloud service provider.

Using virtulization we can create the VM (virtual Machine) divide the hardware into the vartual machine

virtulization and hypervisor are used to create the virtual machine and Amazon web service is used to create the instances 1 and 2 like that
so instance is nothing but the virtual server..

Amazon EC2 Hands on 
For creating server we need AMI (Amazon machine instance) it can be used to create one or multiple instances
There are two method for creating instances 
1.By using AWS Console 
2.By using CLI mode 
   
AWS console 
When we want to create the virtual server then we go to the EC2 => EC2 Dashboard => Launch Instance
Various step are involve to launch the instance
step 1 : Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image) => mean which orperating system we want ot launch the instance
step 2 : Choose Instance Type => that mean how much processor we want to give , how many ram we want to give 
step 3 : Configure instance => how many instances we want in which zone we want 
step 4 : Add storage => how much storage we want 
step 5 : Add Tags  => for identifying the virtual server we need tag mean we can tag it like that is webserver and that mail server
step 6 : Configure security group => who can access those instances
step 7 : review => before we go the final go we can review the setting

steps:
login to aws
select the region 
services => EC2 => instances => Launch instances

Step 1)  Choose an Amazon Machine Image(AMI)

  we need to choose the operating system based on the architecture mean wheather its 64 or 32 bit 
 => select Amazon Linux 2 AMI ,SSD volume  64-bit(x86) and click on select Type make sure its Free tier eligible

Step 2) Choose an Instance type
 => select as per need and make sure which is also free
