-Pay on demand dont own hardware
-Reduced Total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational Expense(OPEX)

Benefit from massive economies of scale
-price are reduced as ASW is more efficient due to large scale

Stop guessing cpacity

What is Auto Scaling groups?

Instances are create by Auto scaling group According to the traffic on website/Application  

The goal of Auto Scaling groups is to scale out (add EC2 Instances) to match an increased laod
Scale in (to remove the EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
Automatically registered a new instances to a load balencer
Replace a unhealthy instances
as the more and more load is generated then the load balencer create the EC2 instances and distribute the load among them
