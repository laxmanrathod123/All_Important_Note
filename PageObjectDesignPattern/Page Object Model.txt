Page Object Design pattern work
Note:
Page Object do not hold any hard coded data . it only focus on object and action method 
for every page create separate ,separate classes 
Reusable class is parent class for every class and that can be reuse in any class based on there usability
So there are two way to use the reusable method 
1.you can crate object of class (but that is not good for memory use)
2.use inheritance concenpt extend that class to child class(wherever you see extend keyword in class that mean we are exteding
the reusable class )

Reusable method should be generic that should not be hard coded

like login page , home page, product page etc. whatever

1.Landing page/login page/login page
All the object belong to login page need to create here
driver is main important 
we need to give driver from main test classess to page object classes how we are giving by creating the object of that class in 
main class and in argument we are providing driver
then 
we need to catch that driver in page object class by creatin constructor 
and
suppose same driver we need to give to parent class which is inheritating by child class using extend keyword then on same class
need to write super(driver) and this driver we can catch in parent class by creating a constructor.

so every child class which is extending the parent class that class need to give the driver to the parent class 

constructor
constructor is execute first when touch your class . means constructor will call out before class execution 

How to assign driver life from one class to another class
eg. suppose we have standalone test and page factory class 
so if you want to assign the driver from standalone test to page factory class you can create constructor in page factory class
and give the life of driver from main class 

public LandingPage(WebDriver driver){
this.driver= driver; => this driver is comming from standalone test and we are assigning to the local current class driver
PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
}
initElement of pagefactory will intialise all the webelement
