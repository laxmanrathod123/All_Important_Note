FileHandling in Java 

File handling its the concept by using we can read and write the data

Read content form the file and write content from the file

There are two way to read the file 
1.reading the file by integer and then converting into the char
2.reading the file by line and no need to conver into the string cause return type is already string


1.Way to read the file

File f= new File("pass the path of the file");
FileReader fr= new FileReader(f);
int i=fr.read().
while(i!=-1){
System.out.print((char)i);
i=fr.read();
}

2.Way to read the file using bufferedReader
File f= new File("pass the path of the file");
FileReader fr= new FileReader(f);
BufferedReader br= new BufferedReader(fr);
String str=br.readLine()
while(str!=null){
System.out.print(str)
str=br.readLine();
}
