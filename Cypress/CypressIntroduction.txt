Cyress   Cypress.io is the official website	

Cypress its a front end web Automation Testing tool and its specially developed for modern web Applicaton Previousaly we have different type of 
webapplication and which is developed by using Static html,css and some piece of javascript They are all traditional web application and 
 Now a day many of the application are designed by using latest technology or latest javascript framework like we have :=>
1.React js 
2.Angular js 
so this type of framework are using webapplication developement and those application are basically called as modern based application so to test 
this specific type of application we need specific type of feature and which is present in the cypress so cypress is specially designed for webAutomation
and we can automate modern webAutomation in cypress and they are designed by using React js , AngularJs and so on	 	

Any by using cypress we can automate any kind of automation which runs on browsers we can automates and basically its use Javascript and morever its
open source 

TestRunner(Cypress App): Its free version availabel We can use for to write a script and desing a framework and do 80% if work on automation

Dashboard : Its apIts a paid version for mainting the test history or we can say if we want to run our test cases parallely then we need this feature

Cypress is specically build on node js environment  and its comes with npm module (npm - node package manager) and we use this for downloading the
cypress and installing the cypress

So cypres is front end webapplication testing tool and specially designed for modern application and we can automate any application which is run 
on browser

And internally we write our test case using JavaScript its support only java script and we also use Typescript because typescript is desinged on top 
of javascript and doesant use selenium libraries and its totally different from selenium .

If you want to run your test cases then we need node js envirnment and comes with npm module

Who can use cypress
And initially cypress is specially developed for developers to perform unit testing and itegration testing
so Specially cypress is designed for end to end automation test cases so we can automate end to end test cases

Use of cypress  Who can use cypress both QA and DEV

1. End to End test cases
2.Integration test cases
3.Unit test cases
4.And also API Testing

Difference Between Selenium and Cypress

Selenim                                                                             cypress

Application Support
1. In selenium we can only automate web                                      1. In cypress we can automate web testing and API Testing

Cost
2.It totally free and open source                                            2. In cypress only Test Runner is free and Dashboard is paid

SetUp and Installation
3.Difficult                                                                  3. easier


Languages
4. Java, python, C#, Rubby JavaScript                                        4. Cypress support only java script and typescript

Browser Support
5.Selenium support all browser
like chrome, firefox, explorer, opera, safari                                5. Chrome , edge ,firefox and electron

Framework support
6.Junit, TestNg, Pytest based on programming languages                       6. Mocha JS

Performance
7.Run outside of the browser so performance is slower than cypress           7. Our Test run inside the browser so perfomance is faster than selenium

Reporting
8.Integrate with Extend, Allure etc                                          8. we have only one report that is mocha report, cypress dashboard




These are the basic different between them

Cypress EcoSystem 
1.Test Runner - use - set up and start and to run the test case
2.Dashaboard - use- record and play version(watch your all videos of test cases)


Feature
1.Time Travel  (Its take screen shot automatically when our test is runnig) 
each and every line of code screenshot will do the cypress and maintained the history

2. Debugging
3.Automatic wait (build - in- wait)  means it will autimatically wait for the weblement and that is biggest adavantage
4.consistency - if you run n number of time then you will get same result the test case not failed but in selenium if we do so then might be test case are fail
5.our test is runnin inside of the browser its also biggest advantage
6.Screenshot and videos will automatically capture and these feature are inbuild in cypress no need to write additional code
7.Crossbroser testing support we can run our test case on defined browser

 Limitation
1.we can not autimate window based or desktop and mobile based application
2. we have limited support of browser
3.for languages perpective it only support only Javscript and typescript
4.Its tough to read data from the file (reading and writing is difficult)
5.Third party reporting tool limited
