Test NG

How to create the TestNG PageDesignPattern project

1.Creat Maven Project with archetype as quickstart
2.Add dependencies in the POM.xml file 
i.    selenium
ii.   test ng
iii.  WebDriverManager



testng.org is the official website

go to the eclipse marketplace
search for test ng and installed

how to check test ng is installed or not
go to window and click on preferences and type test ng you will see or else if you are not able to install the test ng from marketplace then go to
official website and find out the ecliplse plugin for test ng and copy that url and paste it in installed software tab .

how to run test with Test Ng
With the annotation @Test

we can define multiple test cases in one class

in xml file
 if you dont want to run any particular test cases or say like method 
then you just write 

in methods tag of class <exclude name="name of that method "/> so that defined particular method is not execute

and suppose there is requirement like dont run 38 method out of 40 method then how can you do that 
=> so every time its not possible to write exclude 38 time so we have
include tag and define this 2 methods into that include tag

<include name="defined the method name "/>
<include name= "defined the method name "/> 

then only 2 method will run instead of 40 methods


and suppose there is method with starting as mobile and having 100 method we dont want to run all that 

then how to do that 

<exclude name ="mobile.*"/>  so this mean all the method start with mobile are not going to be execute 


Run your test cases on package level

Q: How to run your all test cases in one package

A: simply create one xml file and define test and packages and defined the name of package you want to run


Test NG Annotation

@BeforeTest 

suppose we have multiple classes that is in one test in xml file and we want to run any one particular method from all method then that particular
method is having @BeforeTest tag then it will execute first from all method define in any class

@AfterTest 
similary for the @AfterTest method will execute at last of all method execution  it will valid only for the test folder not for entire suite

NOTE: if this annotation belongs to one test folder and in xml you have more than one test folder then only where the annotation is defined there 
this will applicable not in all test folder 

@BeforeSuite

The scope of the suit is on entire xml file means it will execute first and for the test the scopet of BeforeAfterTest is only up to the test folder

@AfterSuite
 It will execute at the last and the scope of this suite is valid for the entire suite 

@BeforeMethod 

It will execute before every method in the class like if there are five method in th class so before all these five method these BeforeTest annotation 
method will execute first 

Use: 
it will use for deleting the cache and the cookies for executing the every method

@AfterMethod 

It will execute after the all each and every method is executed scope is only upto the class level

@BeforeClass

Before executing all the method present in the class BeforeClass method will execute first and similarly after execution of all method present in the 
class AfterClass annotation method is execute at lat 

scope of this annotation is upto the before class level 
suppose we have ten method in class and without touching the execution of all ten method if you want to run any method before that then you can use 
this BeforeClass annotation 

similarly,

@AfterClass 

similarly after execution of all method present in the class this annotation method will execute at last


groups

Requirement like if I have 100 test cases and I want to run only 4 out them then how should  I run then at this time groups is usefull 

When you want to run any method from different different classes as a part of smoke test then you will use groups and just inlcude then and if you dont 
want to run any particular test cases as well then you can mention exclude so except all excluded test cases remaining all method will execute
so you can include a groups and excludes a groups

to define group in xml file 
suite 
test
groups 
run 
<include name ="Smoke" /> 
run
classes
class 
clasees/>           => this is the flow
test
suite

At class level all the method present in the class is executed as per the Alphabetical orders .

This is all about the xml file




Helper attributes:

<suite parallel="tests" name="Suite">

If we want to run our test cases in two same browser at the same time then we can defined in this way in xml file and our test cases run parallel

1. dependsOnMethods

This is the feature of testng where suppose if we want to run particular method before any specific then we can use this tag .
suppose Iamexecutefirst() this is  the method and Iamexecutelast() this is the method and if you want to run second method first then on first method
you need to define this tag

Iamexecutefirst(dependsOnMethods={"Iamexecutelast"})   => its means the second method will execute first instead of first method

you can defined multiple methos as well 


2. nabled=false  To off the test cases

It will not run that particular method where we defined this helper attributes enabled=false, It mean this method will be skipped and not run 


3.Parameters (global environment variables can be added in xml file with parameterizations)

its work like configurations properties files 
you can defined you global parameters like urlname from the xml file 

<parameter name="URL" value="https://www.google.com"/>

@Parameters({"URL","API Key"})
@Test
public void parameterizedmethod(String url, String apikey){
System.out.println(url)
System.out.println(apikey)
}




4.timeOut
@Test(timeOut=4000)   => it will wait upto the four second
we can giv timeout for the particular method .In case if some method taking time to execute and you dont want to make it fail then you can defined 
the time out


5.DataProvider

Famous interiview question 

How do you achieve parameterization in test ng? 
Ans:  By using dataProvider and form test ng xml file by using parameter where we can mentioned our global variable so this are the two way to achieve
the parameterization in test ng

Listeners in Test NG

Whenever test cases is failed then test ng have feature like to get the screenshot or other detail like pass or fail the test by using ITesListernes

Its an interface having their own methods and we need to write the code inside there methods 

Running Test Parallely with Test Ng

Need to add Parallel tag and thread count in the xml file
suppose we need to run the test folder so you can mention the parallel tag at suite level
and suppose if you want to make execute classes as well in parallel then you should mention the parallel tag at test level

example : 
<suite name="Loan Department " parallel name="tests" thread-count ="6"/>

this is for the test level

and for the class level just defined this in test folder
<test name="personal loan parallel " parallel name="classes" thread-count ="2"/>
