step to follo for implementing the page object design pattern

first step
create page object package and class for the landing page and defined all the relevant locator into it
1.username 
2.pass
3.button

in this class there is no any value for the driver right so need to create the constructor and assign the driver of main class to the costructor


How to use the reusable method in main class where we are running our test cases
just extends this reusable method to main class so this reusable method require driver 
How to send the driver to the reusable method

Ans: By using super keyword i.e super(driver)

so the every child class of page object that is extending the parent reusable class that needed a driver must
means: 
if Abstract class is our reusable class so and if this class is exteded by the pageobject class then each and every page object class need to give
driver to that reusable class by writing super(driver)


How to optimize the code
suppose we submit the credential like username and password then we are going on landing page so that landing page object creation is do in the same 
login method

if we do so then we need to change the written type of the same method
