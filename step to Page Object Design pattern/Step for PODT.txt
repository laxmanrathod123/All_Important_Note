step to follow for implementing the page object design pattern

first step
create page object package and class for the landing page and defined all the relevant locator into it
1.username 
2.pass
3.button

Key poit
1.Page object do not hold any data it hold only the webelement and action method 
2.Reusable class is parent class and that will use all the child class so to get the properties of parent class we use inheritance concept here.
3.If our parent reusable class is getting driver from page object class then its every page object child class duty is to serve the driver to the 
parent class by using super keyword.
4.Validation can not go into the page object class.

in this class there is no any value for the driver right so need to create the constructor and assign the driver of main class to the costructor


How to use the reusable method in main class where we are running our test cases
just extends this reusable method to main class so this reusable method require driver 
How to send the driver to the reusable method

Ans: By using super keyword i.e super(driver)

so the every child class of page object that is extending the parent reusable class that needed a driver must
means: 
if Abstract class is our reusable class so and if this class is exteded by the pageobject class then each and every page object class need to give
driver to that reusable class by writing super(driver)


How to optimize the code
suppose we submit the credential like username and password then we are going on landing page so that landing page object creation is do in the same 
login method

if we do so then we need to change the written type of the same method
