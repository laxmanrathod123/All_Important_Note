Serialization and Deserialization of Request/Responses with POJO Classes

Serialization : converting Request body(payload) into java object

Deserialization : converting the response(payload) into the java object

Serialization :

Need to create the pojo class for the same and initialise the variable and create getter and setter method and then create the 
object of this class and passed into the body method 

key point
1. if the variable having the child object then need to create the child class for the same and then inject into the initialise variable as class

2. if the varaible contain the Array then defined the variable at the time of initialization as an List and then and the time of injecting create the
Arrraylist and add the element into it and then inject the obhect of ArrayList into setter method of the Array

3. All the input need to provide in the setter method
