Exel data read

Need two dependencies of Apache
1.poi-ooxml
2.poi

Step
To get the control over the entire entire exel sheet we need to 

create the object of the XSSfWorkbook class  Then we have access to the  n nubmer of sheet present in the workbook

Sheet is collection of n number of rows and the from the sheet we go and access all the rows

Then once you get th access to the row then we have access to all the cell of the rows

Then once you get hte acess to the cell then you can pull the data from that rows

Step

Create the object of the XSSFWorkbook class
Get the Access to the all the sheet present in the workbook
Get the acess to all the rows of the sheet
Get the access to specific rows from all the rows
Get the acess to specific cell of the row
Access the data from excell into array

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("Give the path of the file");
XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook (fis);          // at this stage we have acess to all sheet present in the workbook i.e we have access to the workbook
 int sheets =workbook.getNumberOfSheet();

for (int i= 0; i<sheets; i++){
  if(workbook.getNameOfSheet(i).equalIgnoreCase("TestData")){           // Next Step

  XSSFSheet sheet=workbook.getSheetAt(i);

    Iterator<Row>rows=sheet.iterator();
   Row firstrows= rows.next();
      Iterator<Cell>cv= firstrows.cellIterator();
int k=0;
int column=0;
while(ce.hasNext()){
        Cell value= cv.next();
        if(value.getStringCellValue().equalIgnoreCase("TestCases")){
          column=k;
           }
k++;
}
System.out.println(column);

while(rows.hasNext()){

Row r=rows.next();
if(r.getCell(column).getStringCellValue().equalIgnoreCase("purchase"){
Iterator <Cell> cv=r.cellIterator();
while(cv.hasNext()){
System.out.println(cv.next().StringCellValue());

}
}
}
}                                                                  // At this stage we have an acess to the our mention sheet that is TestData
}

// My requirement are identifying the test case column by scaning entire first rows
// Once we identify the rows then we need to scan that entire rows of that column
i.e once column is identified then scan the entire testcase column  and identify the purchase tstcase 
// after yo grab that puchase row pull all the data of that row and feed it to test
