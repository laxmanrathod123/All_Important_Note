selectorhub and chropath


In console of inspect we can assure how may result for the identify locator attribute
 for css selector
$('p.error')

put $ and () paste inside this in single coat

for xpath

$x('//input[@placeholder="Name"]')


CSS Selector

clasname 
tagname.classname

id 
tagname#id

tagname[attribute='']


    Link Text assist with anker tag a <a  This represent the link text


Xpath

// tagname=[@a.n='a.v']

if you dont have number of element matching to this locator then passed the index i.e if shows four element match then just give after that xpath
[2]  => This will point to the second element which you are looking for
This is callled indexing method

This is for xpath 
//input[@type='text'][2]

This is for css selector
input[type='text']:nth-child(2)

customize xpath

// parenttagname singleslash childtagnem

customize css 
 parenttagename space childtagname  => no need to // into this

Following-sibling

suppose we have found eg. button is located three time and that is constantly changing then we need to write a customize xpath and that should not fail
then we use this

<button
<button
<button
//header/div/button[1]/following-sibling::button[2]
so xpath should like that => following-sibling::button[2]  -> This represent the secong button 

how to go to reverse

//header/div/button[1]/parent::div      just give one forward slash and then write parent::and tag name
