Dropdown

Static dropdown

In this dropdown option we see is fix
Mostly select drodown are nothing but static

Static dropdown is handle by using Select class

There are three method of select class which are as 
1.selectByIndex();
2.selectByVisibleText();
3.selectByValue

Dyanamic Dropdown

see the how many element for the same dropdown for that element and if we found the two dropdown
Then explicitly write the xpath for that two dropdown element 
()[2] => like this but some of the compony may not allowed the indexing so that time use relationship xpath

//div[@id='glsctl00_mainContent_ddl_destinationStation1_CTNR'] //a[@value='MAA']  given a space after parent xpath


In AutoSuggestive dropdown need to store the elements in the list and iterate it and then use equalIgnorecase and click on it
