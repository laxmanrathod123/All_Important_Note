Stream In Java

Stream API id new feature available from java 8

Take the object of ArrayList and perform the stream operation on that object

Object of Stream is arr

Long L=arr.stream().filter(ele->ele.startWith("A")).count();
System.out.println(l)
// It will print the count of letter A which is present the arrayList
explanation:

we have taken array list in Stream 
filter() // This method scan all the element parallely not in sequence so Stream will reduce our time and this is called intermediate operation perform on stream
filter is one of the intermediate operation

count() is the terminal operation 

====================================================================================================================================================
ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
		names.add("Abhijeet");
		names.add("Jeetu");
		names.add("Akash");
		names.add("Alok")
Long l=names.stream().filter(ele-> ele.startsWith("A")).count();

stream()
here we are converting the arrayList in stream

filter(ele-> ele.startsWith("A"))

After we are applying a filter method that will filter the action and which is called intermediat operation

count();   This is the terminal operation
