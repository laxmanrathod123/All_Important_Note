Git Command to connect Repository and push our code

git config --global user.name "Laxman"                         => You need to tell who you are so name is given 
git config --globla user.email "laxmanrathod2142@gmail.com"    => Provide email 
git init     => for initialising our folder to read the git 
git add*     => add is command which say that add you files to stash and * represent add everything
git status   => what are the file are added to the stash  

git commit -m "write a message for commit"
=> commit stand for the file we are commiting for repository

m stand for the message for the commiting 
and in double coat we need to write the message for the commit

git remote add origin paste the git hub link here

This line will connect remote repository to our local repository

git push origin master  => This command will push the code to master branch of Repository

if you done some changes and we need to take the pull then write the below command

git pull origin master  => This command will download the latest changes have been made through project


End to End flow for push and push 

 To add the local project to repository

git init 
git add *
git status
git commit -m "This is my commit"
git remote add origin paste the link here for the project 
git push origin master

To get the latest pull or to get the latest code from central repo

git init
git clone paste the repository url


To get the latest pull with latest modify code write the belowe command

git init
git pull origin master  => This command will download the latest code changes done anyone to repository

 
                     Branching 


 Branching means to extract the sub-brach from the master brach and all team do their work in sub-branch they will not touch the master branch

after a couple of month and day if the architech realise that the branch is ready execute all over test cases then they simply merge develop branch

into master brach so this is the concept

how to create the sub-branch

git checkout -b develop 

checkout =>stand for extract the new branch from the master 
-b stand =>for name of the new brach
develop  => its a branch name so afer hitting this commmand its copies the code into new branch

if you want to know in which branch i am then just write the below command

git branch   => it will all the branches and point the brach where you are in


so now we are in develop branch and we just added few test cases and we need push our code then do the same code

git add *

git status  => check the changes we made 

git commmit -m "This is commit from new develop brach"

git push origin develop  => This time we need to write the name of the new brach


Then if another person want to take pull from the created develop branch then that person need to take the pull from that branch and convert into 
develop brach here we go

git pull origin develop  => This command will download the latest code

git checkout develop   => This command will switch the master branch into the develop brach

if you want to delete brach then

git branch -d nameofthebrach   => -d stand for delete the branch


How to merge develop branch into the master brach

first you have swith to master branch

git checkout master

git pull origin master => make sure you have latest code up to date

git merge develop
