Wait In Selenium

1.ImlicitWait
2.ExplicitWait
3.Thread.sleep()
4.fluent wait

1.pageLoadTimeout(provide time in number, TimeUnit.SECOND);

pageLoadTimeout will instruct driver like boss please wait for the 40 second to page load and then perform the action
its dyanamic in Nature if our page is loaded with in 2 second then rest of the 38 second will be ignore means its not wait for the remaining second again thats why its
its called dynamic in nature


Syntax
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30));  // pageload wait 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30));   // imlicitwait

ImlicitWait

Hey wait for n number of second before you throw the exception means wait for the specific amout of time and if you not find the element then you 
shoud fail.

Its global wait we are defining it globally
if you give the wait of 30 second and webelement is found with in 3 sec then rest of the second will ignore
drawback 
if in our script some of the element is not present like 4 element is not present and we are set gloabal wait to identify this then wait for all the
element and fail so there is wastage of time there.

and suppose one of the element should be load within 2 sec and we apply the wait of 5 second then this is defect and we cant find it through the wait
 so its disadvantage of this wait, so its come into performance issue
means performance issue is not caught

ExplicitWait
In explicit wait you can target specific element and wait
wait is apply only at target element 
you add to add more code with that specific line

Thread.sleep() 
static wait not ignore the remaining second after the element is found

fluentWait
In fluent wait there is polling time means if we give the fluet wait of 10 sec and then give polling time of 2sec then every 2 sec it will scan the 
element is there or not 
so its monitors on regular interval of times
