Loops in Java

1.While Loop

key points
1.we need to inialiase first
2.second is conditional part
3.Increment or decrement part

Drawback/Disadvantage
 if we not give increment or decrement part then loop will go in infine 

2. For loop 

In for loop intialization , conditional and increment and decrement part are in single line 

3.do while loop

it will print the value without checking the condition

4.If else

we need to give condition in if : if The condition is true then it will print the if statement 
or if the condition is false its not print the statement which is present in the if statement
