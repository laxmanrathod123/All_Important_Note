java -version  
To check the version of the java is installed in our system or not

why we need set the java path in our environment variable

Create java project
file-> New-> JavaProject->Type the name of the project ->done
After click on SRC folder New-> Package

How to execute our file in CMD
Go to that folder where out file is present and open cmd from there
Then write the following command
javac EnterFileName.java  eg.Program51.java  
java EnterFileName

javac Program51.java
java Program51 

Then you will get the execution	
Static and Non Static
we can make static to variable,method,class,and object

whenever we create object it will create a memory
multiple object Hence, so multiple memory is to be created

Variable 
Global variable
whatever we write inside of the class and which is outside of the main method that is global variable
outside of the main method and inside of the class

Static
Static pool 
Only the static data is loaded into the static pool Memory
Three way to call static data
1.by using object
2.by using class name
3.by using direct their name

so for static data only single copy is made cause all data are loaded in static pool and loaded at compile time
and for nonstatic data whenever we create multiple object then multiple copies are going to be create and loaded
at the time of object creation

Note: You can not called any non static data in Static method like main method if you do so you need to create the 
object for the nonstatic data and make that object as static then and then you can call it
