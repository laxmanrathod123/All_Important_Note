Array 

In java Array is an object 
At the time of declaration we can not provide the size of the arrray only at the time of creation we provide the size of the array
int ar[];===> declaration
ar= new int [3]; ===> creation 
Static Array is called the one diamentional Array
Object is superclass of Array means Java ke andar jitane bhi object hai vo heap memory ke andar store hote hai so array bhi heap memory ke andar store hoga
Array is used to store similar data type value in Array variable (That variable value store in java memory)
Array is homegeneous type of data and only store similar kind of data like array of int ,array of short, array of long like that
Syntax

First way  ---->>>>>>>>>>> Single Diamentional Array

int ar[]= {10,20,30,40};     // here we will dyanamically increasing the value of array

Second Way

int ar[]= new int[5];
int ar[]= new int[]{10,20,30,40,50};  // this is also way of declaration creation and initialization
ar[0]=10;
ar[2]=20;
ar[3]=30;
ar[4]=40;
ar[5]=50;

 Second way ---->>>>>>>>>>> Two Diamentional Array
int ar[][]= {{10,20,30},{40,50,60},{70,80,90}};

int ar[][]= new int [3][2];         //   int ar[row][column] ar= new int [2][3];  means two rows and three column 
		ar[0][0]=10;
		ar[0][1]=20;
		
		ar[1][0]=30;
		ar[1][1]=40;
		
		ar[2][0]=50;
		ar[2][1]=60;

---->>>>>>>>>>> Three Diamentional Array
 int ar[][][]= new int [2][3][4];

** If you want to store many value in a single variable then we will go for array or we can use array there
eg. int a=30;
 
so the variable a is storing 30 value if we want to store again any value in this variable then the value should be replace 
 a=50; so the value of a becomes 50 ;

to overcome this array come into picture

only same data type of element we cant store
we can not store multiple data type element

There are two type of Array 
1.Single diamentional Array  --->>> int a[]= new int[5];
2.Multidiamentional Array    ====>>>i.Two diamentional Array ii.Three Diamentional Array     --->>> int a[][]= new int[5][3];   row and column

Disadvantages of Array
1.Array is fixed in size (Thats why is called static array) if we give more than size then it will give arrayoutofbondexception
2.It only store similar data type of Array like int , string like that

Advantage of Array
1.we can store more than one value in a array variable
2.we can store multiple datatype in object Array
3.Array is fast as compare to primitive data type(Speed of the array is fast)
